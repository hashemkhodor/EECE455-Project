# Cybersecurity Encryption Platform

## Introduction

This project presents a full-stack cybersecurity website designed for robust and intuitive encryption services. Our platform integrates classical and modern encryption techniques, including AES, DES, and polynomial arithmetic within the Galois field GF(2^m), to provide a seamless and efficient encryption experience. 

## Features

- **Classical and Modern Encryption Algorithms:** From Hill, Playfair, Monoalphabetic, and Affine ciphers to AES and DES, our platform covers a broad spectrum of encryption techniques.
- **Polynomial Arithmetic:** Advanced implementation of polynomial arithmetic in Galois fields, enhancing cryptographic functions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring a hassle-free user experience without the need for manual customization.
- **Technical Rigor:** Underpinned by mathematical precision, offering reliability and security in data encryption.

## Tools & Languages Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask
